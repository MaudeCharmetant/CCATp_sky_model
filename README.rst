===============

**ccatp_sky_model** provides a model of the microwave sky that will be used for 
   science forecasts for the CCAT-prime survey. The sky model combines maps from
   numerical simulations of extragalactic sources with the most recent Galactic
   foregrounds maps based on Planck data.
